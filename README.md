# What is Functional Programming?
Functional programing is the process of building software by composing *pure functions*, avoiding *shared state*, *mutable data*, and *side effects*. Functional programming is *declarative*   as opposed to beign *imperative* where the reader of that code somewhere down the line has to read and mentally execute it to understand it.
