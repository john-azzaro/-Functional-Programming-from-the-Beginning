# What is Functional Programming?

***Functional programing (FP) is a paradigm where the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects.*** Functional programming tends to be *provable*, *concise*, *predicatable*, and *easier to test* than other programming paradigms such as Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

**Functional programming is *declarative* in that your code should tell a story.** For example, when you comment on code you need to explain the "why" and not the "what", such as why you have a for-loop iterating over an array rather than saying you have a for-loop which should be obvious.

**In contrast to the declaritve is the *imperative* where the reader of that code somewhere down the line has to read and mentally execute it**. In essence, code being imperiative means inferring from the code to understand what it is doing. In this way, imperative code can be harder to fix and maintain.
