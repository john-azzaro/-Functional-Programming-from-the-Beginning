# What is Functional Programming?
Functional programing is the process of building software by composing *pure functions*, avoiding *shared state*, *mutable data*, and *side effects*. 

Functional programming is *declarative* in that your code should tell a story. For example, when you comment on code you need to explain the "why" and not the "what", such as why you have a for-loop iterating over an array rather than saying you have a for-loop which should be obvious.

Declaritive is opposed to the *imperative* where the reader of that code somewhere down the line has to read and mentally execute it to understand it, in essence inferring from the code to understand what it is doing. In this way, imperative code can be harder to fix and maintain.
